Statistics 133


Description of Project:
	This project will take a look at data on the Golden State Warriors. I will investigate how the 5 starters in the 2016 season performed with special focus on their shooting. The structure of this project will be divided into six sections. First, I will provide background and some context on the Golden State Warriors. I will then present the data used and how it was manipulated through R-scripts. I will then go through the different analyses I utilized to investigate the shooting performance. The next section will be a discussion and thorough examination of the previous analyses. I will then conclude the paper and offer suggestions for future research. References will be listed at the end of the report as well as at the bottom of the document.
