2. Cooking Recipe <br/>
=======================

Multigrain Apple Crisps
-----------------------

### Ingredients

-   4 large or 5 small-medium apples (about 2 pounds)
-   1 tablespoon cornstarch
-   3 tablespoons plus 1/4 cup raw or Turbinado (often sold as Sugar in the Raw) sugar
-   1/4 cup plus 3/4 cup rolled oats
-   1/4 cup sliced or slivered almonds
-   1/2 cup whole wheat flour
-   1/4 cup light or dark brown sugar
-   1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
-   Two pinches sea salt
-   1/2 teaspoon baking powder
-   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
-   1/4 cup olive oil

### Special Kitchen Tools Needed

-   Food Processor
-   Medium Bowl
-   Small Saucepan
-   Tray
-   Aluminum Foil

### Steps

1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees
2.  Arrange eight 6-ounce ramekins on a baking tray
3.  Peel, halve and core apples, then chop them into a small (about 1/2-inch) dice
4.  Toss apples with 1 tablespoon cornstarch and 3 tablespoons raw sugar until evenly coated, then divide apples between ramekins
5.  Grind 1/4 cup oats with almonds in a food processor until powdery
6.  In a medium bowl, mix oat/almond mixture with remaining rolled oats, wheat flour, remaining 1/4 cup raw sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, sea salt and baking powder
7.  Melt butter in a small saucepan (or in microwave), then stir in olive oil
8.  Pour mixture over dry ingredients and stir until crumbly
9.  Divide crumbs over each dish of apples, packing them on with your palms if needed to get them all on (don’t worry, the apples will deflate a bit when they bake)
10. Bake apple crisps for about 30 to 40 minutes
11. If tops brown too quickly, put a sheet of foil over the whole tray for remaining baking time

### *Other Information on Apple Crisps*

This delicious recipe is most well enjoyed during the fall season. You can also alter this recipe and replace the apples with pineapples to make [pineapple crisps](http://yellebellyboo.blogspot.com/2012/01/fresh-pineapple-crisp.html).

3. Euclidean Distance
=====================

### Definition

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the [line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment) connecting them ($\\overline{\\textbf{pq}}$).

In [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates), if **p** = *(p1, p2,..., pn)* and **q** = *(q1, q2,..., qn)* are two points in [Euclidean *n*-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space), then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the [Pythagorean formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem):

$$  \\begin{align}
d(\\textbf{p},\\textbf{q}) = 
d(\\textbf{q},\\textbf{p})  &= 
\\sqrt{(q\_1-p\_1)^2+(q\_2-p\_2)^2 + . . . + (q\_n-p\_n)^2} \\\\ \\\\ 
&= \\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^{\\infty} (q\_i-p\_i)^2 }. 
\\end{align}  $$

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector). So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The [**Euclidean norm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_norm), or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$$\\  \\left\\lVert \\textbf{p} \\right\\rVert = \\sqrt{p\_1^2 + p\_2^2 + . . . + p\_n^2} = \\sqrt{\\textbf{p} \\cdot \\textbf{p}} $$

where the last expression involves the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).
