In this project, I created a Shiny App that allows individuals the ability to visualize how their savings can change over time, based on their investment and saving habits.

####  Structure
This project contains a file called workout02app-noah-forougi.R. This R script contains the code for the Shiny app. 
This project contains another subdirectory called rsconnect that allowed me to publish this app online. 


#### Application Published
The published and publicly available application can be found [here](https://noah-forougi.shinyapps.io/Workout02-Noah-Forougi/).
