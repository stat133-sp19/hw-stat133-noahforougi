In this project, I created a package called binomial that allows the user to manipulate and work with binomial distributions with ease. 
####  Structure
This project contains all the necessary documentation for a published package. The structure is as follows, within the binomial directory:
* binomial.Rproj
* DESCRIPTION
* devtools-flow.R
* NAMESPACE
* README.md
* man/
* R/
* tests/
* vignettes/


#### Acknowledgements
The work that went into creating this package was done with the great help of Professor Gaston Sanchez' online book, [Pack YouR Code](https://www.gastonsanchez.com/packyourcode/), as well as Hadley Wickham's online resource, [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/package.html)
